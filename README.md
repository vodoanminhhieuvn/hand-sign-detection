# hand-sign-detection

This project is from [Sign Language Detection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doDUihpj6ro) by Nicholas Renotte

But I try to add some my own hand sign data 

- good
- bad
- hello

# Data

My data are not so good since RNN failed to detect my hand signs because of lacking consistency of every frames

# Model

Achieved 80% accuracy on test set, which are not high enough compare to the original model, but it can detect 4 hand signs at them same time

# Demo
